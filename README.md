# TheBeehive
A project to put farmers and small producers or crafters in direct relation to consumers.

Principle:

A sale is set every one or two weeks.
Seven days before, a producer upload or edit the list of items he wants to sell. He provides the name and description of the product, the quantity and the number available.
The consumer is advertised that a sale is going on. He can choose to buy some items or not. He is totally free to buy at one sale and not at the other.
Three days before the distribution, the sale is closed. It helps the producer to pack the products and organize himself.
